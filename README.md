NOPE
========================
Entry for the Github 2015 GameOff with the theme "The Game Has Changed". Based on fork of "Lost-Beneath the Surface"

The goal of the game is to descend as many levels into the maze as possible without meeting your demise. You have an ever shrinking cone of light which you need to maintain by finding matches placed throughout the maze. These help you see more of the maze in order to solve it, as well as giving you the ability to survive an encounter with one of the creatures that inhabits the darkness through which you're traversing. Game is controlled with the arrow keys, and there are more detailed instructions about mechanics in the "How To" page of the game.

LD #29 Entry with theme "Beneath The Surface" - You're a firefly lost in the dark, beneath the surface and must find a way out of the mazes created by the horrors in the dark

Colliding with a horror without wearing a helmet is instant death. You can find helmets strewn around the maze.

Each maze is larger than the last one and is created randomly. Maze generation code is not mine.

Made using the Phaser framework. <3
